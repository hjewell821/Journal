# April 3, 2020: Fluid Text

- over the past week, learning about fluid texts has changed the way I interpret different texts
- the difference between texts has affected how I understand the tone being used and how direct the writing comes off to me
- sometimes, it seems as if an author's writing is being left open for interpretation
- in other cases, the writing seems direct and a specific message is being expressed
