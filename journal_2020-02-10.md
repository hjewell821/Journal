## Review

- navigating the web is connecting to another computer with a file on it
- everything you look at on your computer is a copy... essentially violation of copyright?
- the bit on the end of a file is called a file extension (ex. pdf, .jpg, .html)
- reasons plain text is advantageous: 
1) greater accessibility for those who may have disabilities 
2) easily transformable
3) can be opened with any platform
4) can be viewed through the command line of your computer, and takes up less space

- symbols are importantant in computing**
- html: a language for describing content in a text file for the purpose of presentation on the web (simplified!)
- markup language is essentially telling of how you want the resulting page to look (use of opening and closing tags)
- level 1 and level 2 headings
- inserting an image: <img src= "insert link.jpg" /> (<---There's code behind what made this little picture appear!)
- CSS: a language for assigning styling to markup
