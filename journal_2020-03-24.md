# Ideas for Blog Post #2: How my Perspective has changed based on Digital Humanities

## "English" as a discipline:
- I used to see English only for the reading and writing
- the inclusion of Humanities in this English course taught me that there is much more to English than just reading poetry or prose and writing essays based on analysis

## Literature
- in previous English classes, I only wrote essays and research papers on what I read
- after taking ENGL 340, I know there is a greater variety of ways to analyze what I read (ex. timelines, reoccurence of words in a text/exclusion of stop words, etc.)
- literature can incorporate Humanities and the ways our lives have changed over time based on technology, communication, what we prioritize, etc.

## Reading

- this class opened my eyes to more sources of literature outside of what I typically read
- my other English classes involve reading 18th-century English literature and African novels/folklore/art
-  - these readings have very different content that books like "The Information" and "Walden"; the books read in ENGL 340 gave me a new perspective on what literature can 'be'
