- I learned how to use a basic spreadsheet to make a timeline of events
- when i first saw this task, it seemed daunting especially with the lack of in-class practice
- once I found a clear set of directions to follow and a video tutorial, I was more confident in my abilities to make a similar timeline
- I was glad to learn that it wasn't as hard as it looked in the end and the finished product looked really cool!
