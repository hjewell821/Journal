- "much is published but little is printed"... what does i mean?? there are multiple interpretations to be made here
- is there a lack of diversity within the community of literature
- this relates to my African literature class where we often discuss how language is lost since English has become a primary language associated with success
- working to preserve literature specific to various cultures that need more recognition to promote diversity within the community of literature
- this can also help us to relate to those around us and understand them better

- stop words are excluded from the most frequently used words
