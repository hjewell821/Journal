- It was interesting to see the "Walden" manuscript
- It definitely shows a correlation between Thoreau's lifestyle and the way he chose to write his book by hand
- Seeing these manuscript images gives me a new appreciation for seeing the way that many books used to be written 
- It has more authenticity and reminds me of seeing old written music or reading hand-written letters from family members


This MS image is from page 74:
